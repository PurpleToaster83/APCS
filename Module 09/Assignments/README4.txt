Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to implement a quick check to make the program more efficient so that
    it doesn't check already marked numbers.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble iterating with adding/removing possible primes and IndexOutOfBounds
    errors. However, by using a debugger and stepping through the program I was able to make
    the fixes required.

In the Future:
    I would like to use more lists to keep track of large data sets.
