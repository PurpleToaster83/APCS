Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the method to calculate the
    distance that th eobject would travel.

What went Wrong:
    For a while, I forgot to index the distArray and was printing
    out the memoery location of the object. But once I realized this I was
    able to quickly index so that the program printed the right thing.


In the Future:
    I would like to use more array based data structures, like tensors, in my
    java projects. Additionally, I would like to give more modularity to my programs
    by getting user input for the classes and storing that in a custom matrice.
