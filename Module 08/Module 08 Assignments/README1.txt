Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    Once I had figured out how to do the algorithm with one data type,
    I was able to implement it for the other data type.

What went Wrong:
    I had a bit of trouble implementing a merge sort algorithm to get
    the Music array in the desired format. However, I eventually figured
    out how to use recursion to get the desired effect.


In the Future:
    I would like to implement more algorithms in my programs.
