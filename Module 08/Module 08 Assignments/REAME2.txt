Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to program the search and sort algorithms using the knowledge
    I gained from the unit.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble implementing the binary search for the relationship.
    However, I realized that I needed to sort first and that fixed the problem.


In the Future:
    I would like to learn more advanced searching algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, etc.
