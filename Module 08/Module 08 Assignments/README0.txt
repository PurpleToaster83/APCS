Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily make the changes that the instructions were
    asking for.

What went Wrong:
   I had some trouble with formatting the outputs, but I think I
   figured out how to do it.

In the Future:
    I would like to use something like binary search in a program.
