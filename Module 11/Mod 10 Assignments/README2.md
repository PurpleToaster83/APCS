Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the getter and setter methods
    for the card class.

What went Wrong:
    I feel like my code for different variations of cards within the
    different suits and values was not very efficient.

In the Future:
    I would like to do more game related programming.
