Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily program and implement the different methods to accomplish the task.

What went Wrong:
    I originally forgot that the methods needed to be static becuase I was referencing them within the same class.

In the Future:
    I would like to try to use recursive methods for programs.
