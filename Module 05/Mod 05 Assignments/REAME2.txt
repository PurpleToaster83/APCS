Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the getter functions and print them out.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble with correctly implementing private instance variables but eventually figured it out.

In the Future:
    I would like to try creating a new set of classes other than the car one that I previously have made.
