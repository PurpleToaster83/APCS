Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    When I was searching through the Math Class API documentation, I found that the Math Class already has a method that implements the Pythagorean Theorem. I decided to try using this
    method for my second triangle calculations to demonstrate that there would be two ways of implementing a solution. However, I used pow() and sqrt() in the calculations for my first
    triangle.

What went Wrong:
    It took me a minute to figure out how to initialize a randomized number with both an upper and lower bound.

In the Future:
    Next time I would like to not assign the sides to a variable because -in this case- I am using the operation the same twice. If I didn't use a variable this would decrease the
    space complexity O() of my program solution. However, this would not be a possibility if I referanced the variables more than twice.
