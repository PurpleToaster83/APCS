Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily apply what I had learned from the lesson to the program and got the correct output.

What went Wrong:
    Initially, I forgot that the divideTheseTwo() method did not print so called the method an dnothing happened. However, 
    then I saw that it had not print in it and I would need to acess it within a print statement.

In the Future:
    In the future, I would like to use more complex functions that return different data types.
