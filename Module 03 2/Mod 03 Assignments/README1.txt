Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I was able to easily use the 'or' operator to allow a user to input capital or lowercase letters.

What went Wrong:
    I forgot to initialize a variable to an actual value in the main codeblock before it was used. But I was able to set
    the variable to zero and that fixed the problem.

In the Future:
    In the future, I would like to try using a while loop so if the user does not input the correct value they keep getting
    asked the question until a correct input is given.
