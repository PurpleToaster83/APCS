Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I was able to easily implement the logic operations in the if and if else statements to categorize the user's BMI.

What went Wrong:
    It took me a while to properly implement the type conversions associated with the rounding within the print statements. However, I eventually got it
    after reinspecting the parenthesis and decimal places of the involved expressions.

In the Future:
    In the future I would like to probably use a formatted string for rounding because that method doesn't really involve any additional work like
    the arithmatic rounding that was used does.
