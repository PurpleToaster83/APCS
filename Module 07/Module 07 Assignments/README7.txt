Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily make the changes that the instructions were
    asking for.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble with where to check in the methods but I was able to
    use VSCode's built in debugger to walk throguh the program and observe what
    each line was doing.

In the Future:
    I would like to create a chatbot that uses multidimensional vector space to
    create responses.
