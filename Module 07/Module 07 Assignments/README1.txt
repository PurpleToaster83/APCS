Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily use formatted print statements to create a table for
    the data.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble implementing a non-absolute path into the program. However,
    I realized that my active directory was not what I thought it was and I was able
    to cd into the correct directory.

    Also I feel like the program is very messy, especially with the average, min, and max columns.

In the Future:
    I would like to use more helper-methods in my programs so that the main file is not so
    messy.
