Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I felt really confident in creating the various algroithms needed to
    manipulate the data structure.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble initializing student objects with integer arrays. However,
    I eventually figured out how to initialize them in-line so that the program was
    less messy.

In the Future:
    I would like to learn about more algorithms and use them
    in my programs.
