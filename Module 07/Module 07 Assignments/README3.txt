Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I found it very easy to create the deletions methods.

What went Wrong:
    Although not part of the lesson, I had a lot of trouble with the insertion methods
    for arrays because there was a lot of logic behind where to index when. However,
    by using a debugger and tracing my values, I was able to solve my problem.

In the Future:
    I would like to learn about more algorithms that I can implement in my programs.
