Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I feel like I have a good understanding of how insertion sort works

What went Wrong:
    I had troule with sorting based on the string values. However I realized
    that it didn't look like I sorted the array because I was printing out the
    studio names in the movies slot.

In the Future:
    I would like to learn about more algorithms and use them
    in my programs.
