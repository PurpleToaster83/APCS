Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the methods to calculate the isntance
    variables for the cheesecake objects.

What went Wrong:
    When I downloaded the files off of the classroom, the names were in lowercase
    so that they didn't match the class names. This made it so I couldn't compile and simply
    changing the file names didn't work/ However, after a while I was able to get the files to
    work and have the rights names.

In the Future:
    I would like to try using multi-dimensional arrays/matrices in a program.
