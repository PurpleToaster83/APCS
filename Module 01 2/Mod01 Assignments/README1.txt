Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I was able to understand all of the conecpts in lessons 1.08 and 1.09 and apply them to the program.

What went Wrong:
   The print statements were very tedious to write and so the program took a lot longer to write than I had anticipated.

In the Future:
    In the future I would like to try to use formated print statements for this kind of stuff because it would obviate the neccesity to constantly have
    concatinations and quotation marks. I would also like to shorten some of the operations like 43.21 * 10.0 * 10.0 to just 43.21 * 10.0^2.
