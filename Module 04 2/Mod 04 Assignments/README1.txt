Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I was able to quickly implement the while loop logic to allow a user to generate multiple passwords

What went Wrong:
    I didn't see that there was base source code and so I had already coded most of the program logic once a was the StarterCode406.java file. I probably spent more time
    programming the print statements than was neccesary because I didn't originally see that base code.

In the Future:
    To print out all of the passwords after they have been written I read them out of the new file. I would be curious to see if in the future it might be easier to just
    stick them in an array rather than create a whole scaner object and then read out of the file.
