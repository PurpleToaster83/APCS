Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I was able to easily and quickly implement the while loops and conditional logic to track the data.

What went Wrong:
    I had trouble with downloading the text files. I was not able to just download them by clicking on the links on VLACS. So instead I had to create files in a text editor and then
    copy the contents into the file. However, then I couldn't save the files as .txt files so I had to save them as another file type and then change them later. But that mad it so each line
    was ended with a backslahs. I eventually solved this by copying the proper text into the already converted text files.

In the Future:
    I would like to learn what the order of checking the next token is becuase it might be better to do that in-line rather than saving it as a whole varible depening on the time complexity of
    checking.
