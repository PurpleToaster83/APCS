Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the methods I needed to code and also learned how to format strings
    without printing them to the console by using the java documentation.

What went Wrong:
    I wasn't sure about what the toString() method was supposed to do. So, I just made it so it returned a string that displayed
    all the information of the Student object it was invoked on.

In the Future:
    I would like to use less for loops to reduce the complexity of my program.
