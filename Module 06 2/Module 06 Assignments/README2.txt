Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement more responses for the Magpie chatbot

What went Wrong:
    I sometimes found the instruction confusing and had to really think about what
    I was being asked to do. however, I eventually figured it all out.

In the Future:
    I would like to use large vector fields to map keywords and responses rather than simply parsing input.
