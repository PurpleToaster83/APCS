Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily create a multi-class system in two different files.

What went Wrong:
    I was confused about why so many paramters were passed into the function for
    printing the heading. It might have been easier to make the instance variables
    public and then just pass the obeject as a parameter instead so that you don't have
    to pass so many paramaters in independently.

In the Future:
    I would like to use other list-type data types like link lists and trees.
