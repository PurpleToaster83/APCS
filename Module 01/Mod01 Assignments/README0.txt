Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I forgot to use Java syntax, like semicolons, a lot less than I thought I would. This may partially be due to ,
    VSCode tab-complete which sped up my typing process for the syntactical stuff. I was able to use the end line
    character '\n' effectively to use only one print statement on data-fields that I wanted to print across multiple
    lines, allowing me to do things like choose the format of my paragraph print outs.

What went Wrong:
    Since I was using VSCode for my compiler instead of BlueJ, I had some trouble converting the VSCode Python environment
    I previously had set up to a Java enviorment. However, after some trouble-shooting, I was able to set up the compiler
    properly and begin compiling java files.

In the Future:
    I would like to try utalizing more variables to reduce the time to type out strings that are used multiple times. I also
    feel like some of the formatting stuff I did may work on some terminal/command-prombt/shell outputs but may not work on
    all so I should generalize my formatting stuff more to the size of the window.
