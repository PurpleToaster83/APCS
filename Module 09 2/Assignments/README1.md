Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement getName() methods for all
    the classes.

What went Wrong:
    I was a little confused originally about when to cast the input
    paramter. But I think I understand it now.

In the Future:
    I would like to use more converting between super and subclasses.
