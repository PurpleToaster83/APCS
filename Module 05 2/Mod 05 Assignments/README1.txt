Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement multiple classes and funcitons into a program

What went Wrong:
    I found the instructions to be very confusing and spend a lot of time trying to decipher what I was excpected to do.
    I think I eventually got all of the elements that the assignment needs.

In the Future:
    I would like to expand on this program and develope it more.
