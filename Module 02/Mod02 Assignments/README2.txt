Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily get user input and cast to the needed data type. Additionally, I was able to implement some error handling to make the
    program more robust to mistakes that the user might make.

What went Wrong:
    It took me a while to get the correct format for the error handling. Eventually I figured out that I would need a try-catch within a while loop.

In the Future:
    In the future, I would like to try using the nextInt() and nextDouble() methods in programs that later require those data types from user input.
