Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the logic for the recursion of the fibonacci
    piecewise function.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble with making the scanner for user input. However,
    I quickly remembered how to do it.

In the Future:
    I would like to use recursion for searching algorithms.
