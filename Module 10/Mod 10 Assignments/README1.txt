Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily make methods for insertion and selection sort.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble with creating the recursive merge sort method but
    I think I figured it out.

In the Future:
    I would like to use more algorithms like BFS and DFS.
