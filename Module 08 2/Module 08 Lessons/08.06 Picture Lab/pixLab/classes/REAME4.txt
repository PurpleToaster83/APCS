Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily follow the insturctions after I got everything
    to initially compile.

What went Wrong:
    I was having some trouble loading all the files in the correct place.
    But then I relaized, I needed to change my active directory.


In the Future:
    I would like to use more images and pixels with libraries like
    OpenCV (or the equivalent for Java).
