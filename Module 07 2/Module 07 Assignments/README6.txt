Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily implement the algorithms.

What went Wrong:
    I had some trouble with a error because the compiler wasn't really telling
    me the problem. However, I looked over my code and found that I mispelled something
    and that fixed it.

In the Future:
    I would like to learn about more algorithms and use them
    in my programs.
