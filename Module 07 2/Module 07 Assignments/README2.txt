Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right:
    I was able to easily replace the work with arrays in ElectionTesterV3
    with ArrayLists in ElectionTesterV4.

What went Wrong:
    I had a hard time keeping track of what I had already printed because
    the volume of printlines was so large.

In the Future:
    I would like to use more common algorithms like bubble sort, BFS, and DFS.
