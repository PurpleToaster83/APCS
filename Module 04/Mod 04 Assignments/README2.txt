Post-Mortem Review:

What went Right: 
    I understood how to wokr with methods and parameters so that I was able to fill in the methods and check my work.

What went Wrong:
    I originally misunderstood what I was supposed to do in step D. However, when I was reviewing the requirments I was able
    to quickly correct my mistake.

In the Future:
    In the future I think it would be cool to utalize recursive methods that call on eachtoher.
